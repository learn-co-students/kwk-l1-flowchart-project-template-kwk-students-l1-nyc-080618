    "bio" => "Maren Morris is a singer and songwriter whose music bridges the gap between hard country, classic rock, and hip-hop-influenced pop; she has enjoyed success as both a tunesmith and a performer. Morris was born in Dallas, Texas on April 10, 1990 and she grew up with a love of music, saying she was always willing to belt out a tune on the family's karaoke machine by age ten. By the time she was 14, she had learned to play guitar and began playing professionally, self-releasing a debut album, Walk On. Morris had struck a deal with Smith Music Group when she dropped her second album, 2007's All That It Takes; her songwriting was strong enough that she either wrote or co-wrote eight of the album's 13 tracks. Morris graduated high school and was attending the University of North Texas when she self-released her third full-length, 2011's Live Wire. A year later, she left Texas for Nashville, determined to shift her career into high gear.",

Four years later in 2013, when she was 19, Ballerini signed a publishing deal with Black River Publishing and a recording deal with Black River Entertainment later that same year. A debut single, 'Love Me Like You Mean It,' appeared from the label in 2014; the single slowly became a big hit, reaching number five on the Billboard country singles charts and number one on its country airplay charts. A digital EP, simply titled Kelsea Ballerini, was released in November 2014, and as word about Ballerini spread, she was named one of 2014's Next Women of Country by CMT and appeared on the Grand Ol' Opry for the first time on February 13, 2015. In May 2015, Black River released Ballerini's first full-length album, The First Time; it debuted at four on Billboard's U.S. country charts and 31 on the Billboard Top 200, eventually going gold. In June 2017, Ballerini released 'Legends,' the first single from her follow-up LP Unapologetically, which appeared in November. ~ Steve Leggett, Rovi",

    "bio" => "Miranda Lambert defied all conventional notions of how a credible country career should proceed. Following an adolescence where she alternated between singing and acting, she came to prominence not as the winner but as a runner-up on the 2003 American Idol knockoff Nashville Star, a dubious stepping stone to stardom if ever there was one, but Lambert's 2005 Kerosene obliterated any notion that she was a reality TV refugee. Filled with lithe, powerful, neo-traditional country songs, many penned by Lambert herself, Kerosene established the singer/songwriter as a commercial force to be reckoned with, while its 2007 sequel, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, pulled off the trick of turning her into a superstar while confirming she was a writer of considerable substance. From there, the hits piled up fast and furious -- most of them from her multi-platinum records Revolution, Four the Record and Platinum, but some coming from her side project Pistol Annies -- and tabloid headlines started to flow after she married fellow country star Blake Shelton in 2011. By that point, she could weather the gossip because there was no mistaking Miranda Lambert as anything but a major figure in country music.",

Beginning with 1998's Wide Open Spaces, they struck a balance between the commercial, radio-ready aesthetic of country-pop and the rootsy sound of neo-traditionalist country, a combination that helped distinguish the trio from such concurrent stars as Shania Twain. The Dixie Chicks further distanced themselves from country's conservative boundaries as their career progressed, although their outspoken beliefs -- specifically Natalie Maines' open criticism of the war in Iraq, which ignited a backlash in 2003 -- were sometimes voiced to the detriment of the band's sales. Nevertheless, the Dixie Chicks remained a compelling band in concert and on record, boasting three-part harmonies and an instrumental prowess that was virtually unparalleled among similar groups.",

Her autobiographical single 'Coat of Many Colors' shows the poverty of growing up one of 12 children on a rundown farm in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. At 12 years old, she was appearing on Knoxville television; at 13 she was recording on a small label and appearing on the Grand Ole Opry. Her 1967 hit 'Dumb Blonde' (which she's not) caught Porter Wagoner's ear, and he hired Parton to appear on his television show, where their duet numbers became famous. By the time her 'Joshua' reached number one in 1970, Parton's fame had overshadowed her boss', and she had struck out on her own, though she still recorded duets with him. During the mid-'70s, she established herself as a country superstar, crossing over into the pop mainstream in the early '80s, when she smoothed out the rough edges in her music and began singing pop as well as country. In the early '80s, she also began appearing in movies, most notably the hit 9 to 5. Though her savvy marketing, image manipulation (her big dumb blond stage persona is an act), extracurricular forays into film, and flirtations with country-pop have occasionally overshadowed her music, at her core Parton is a country gal and a tremendously gifted singer/songwriter.",

She loved Elvis Presley as a child and sang in musicals, choral groups, and talent shows while in school. She enrolled at the University of Georgia, but in 1985 she transferred to the music business program at Belmont College in Nashville. Yearwood served an internship with MTM Records and soon moved on to become an in-demand demo singer, which resulted in an up-and-coming Brooks hiring her as a backup vocalist. Yearwood appeared on Brooks' 1989 debut and its blockbuster follow-up, No Fences, and with the help of producer Garth Fundis, she staged a showcase performance in 1990 that landed her a record deal with MCA.",

Skillfully fusing mainstream, AOR rock production with country-pop, Twain and her producer/husband, Robert John Mutt Lange, created a commercial juggernaut with her second album, The Woman in Me. The record became a multi-platinum phenomenon, peaking at number five on the pop charts and eventually selling over nine million copies in America alone. Twain might have sold a lot of records, but like other mega-selling acts before her, she earned few good reviews -- most critics accused her of diluting country with bland, anthemic hard rock techniques and shamelessly selling her records with sexy videos. Fans ignored such complaints, mainly because her audience was comprised of many listeners who had grown accustomed to such marketing strategies by constant exposure to MTV. And Twain, in many ways, was the first country artist to fully exploit MTV's style. She created a sexy, video-oriented image -- she didn't even tour during the year when The Woman in Me was on the top of the country charts -- that appealed not only to the country audience, but also to pop fans. In turn, she became a country music phenomenon.",

Jacqueline spent the next several years as part of Rogers' touring show, and through Rogers she was introduced to Billy Dean and Suzy Bogguss, who invited the young vocalist to join them on a duet single, Keep Mom and Dad in Love, in 2001.",

Her self-titled full-length debut, released through Atlantic Records, arrived in November of that year. The record was a huge success, particularly in Australia, Belgium, Holland, and France, where it shot straight to number one, while it also reached the U.K. Top 20. The collection of stripped-back arrangements mostly comprised indie artists, including the Postal Service and Fleet Foxes, whose songs were overhauled by Bogaerde's haunting voice and sparse production.",

Saviors, a collaborative single with Gosh Pith and Syblyng, arrived a year later, after which Anderson signed with New York label Neon Gold Records. Queen, her debut single for the label, found Flint Eastwood's sound further evolving into sophisticated, bombastic pop. A collaboration with eclectic Flint-based singer/rapper Tunde Olaniran followed in early 2017.",

Meanwhile, her mom played her neo-soul divas like Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill; by the time she was in middle school, she'd added piano, guitar, and songwriting to her repertoire. While studying at St. Andrews School in Delaware, she fell in love with the banjo and folk music, and attended a Berklee School of Music program during the summer after her junior year. Rogers won the program's songwriting contest, which spurred her to focus on writing as high school came to a close. During her senior year, she turned a broom closet into a makeshift studio and recorded what became her first album, 2012's The Echo; Rogers included her demos as part of her application to New York University's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. She released another folky album, 2014's Blood Ballet, during her sophomore year at the school.",

This constant moving meant she didn't have much of a chance to make lasting friendships, so Allen entertained herself with books and, especially, music: she listened to everything from T. Rex, the Specials, and the Slits to the Happy Mondays and drum'n'bass, and even ran away to see the Glastonbury Festival when she was 14. After she left school a year later, she realized that music was the only career for her. Allen concentrated on her songwriting and singing, developing a style that was equally sweet and bratty; late in 2005, she set up a MySpace page and posted demos of her songs, as both individual tracks and as part of two limited-edition mixtapes that also featured tracks by Dizzee Rascal, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Ludacris. The critical acclaim for her work fueled Allen's publicity, leading to tens of thousands of friends on MySpace, airplay on BBC Radio One, and a record deal with Regal/Parlophone before the end of 2005.",

Zinner and O formed the band in 2000; originally, they were a folky duo called Unitard, but they went electric after being inspired by Ohio's legendary avant punk scene. After the drummer they recruited initially bowed out, Chase joined the lineup.",

    "bio" => "Indie electronic project Tei Shi is the creation of musician Valerie Teicher, a native of Buenos Aires, Argentina. She grew up across North and South America, though, spending several years in Bogotá, Colombia; Vancouver, Canada; and Boston, Massachusetts, where she attended the Berklee College of Music. After school, she settled in New York City to pursue music professionally. Teicher uploaded her first Tei Shi single, M&Ms, to music-sharing sites in mid-2013. An R&B-inflected indie pop tune with layered vocal loops, it made waves in the blogosphere and earned an attentive fan base. The song was one of six on the self-released Saudade EP later that year. In the meantime, she was a featured vocalist on tracks by artists including Glass Animals and Shy Girls (Dan Vidmar). She followed up her debut in the spring of 2015 with another EP, Verde, issued by Mom + Pop imprint Mermaid Avenue. Its lead single, the atmospheric dance track Bassically, accumulated seven-figure streams within weeks and appeared on social networking charts. Tei Shi then signed with Downtown Records, which released her full-length debut, Crawl Space, in March 2017. ~ Marcy Donelson, Rovi",

At first, her stylized noir-pop garnered skeptical sneers -- the rise of her 2012 debut Born to Die was impeded by a tentative live debut on Saturday Night Live -- but Del Rey proved to be tougher than her soft exterior suggested. Following a hit remix of her single Summertime Sadness, she steadily gained not only popularity but respect, with her 2014 second album, Ultraviolence, receiving positive reviews to accompany her sales; her imitators, of which there were many, were merely an alluring accessory. By that point, Del Rey had become the ideal she intended to be: a damaged torch singer designed as the tragic romantic icon for her age.",
