<h1> The Impacts of our Daily Actions on Climate Change</h1>
<h2>Climate Change is affected by a few things, including food waste, </h2>

<p>Every year 1.3 metric gigatons of edible food goes to waste. This number is equal to 2,600,000,000,000 metric pounds. The amount of food waste humans produce is massive in size, yet many ignore or remain unaware of its effects. Food waste is surprisingly one of the main contributors to climate change. Due to the immense amount of food waste that ends up in landfills, methane emissions are being produced contributing to climate change. 600,000,000,000 metric pounds.

<p> As a species, humans produce immense amounts of food waste. Humans throw away food daily without thinking twice but never understand the impact. Just looking at America alone, the numbers are quite shocking. According to the USDA, “In the United States, food waste is estimated at about 30-40 percent of the food supply” (“How Much… Matter”). This means close to half of America’s food supply is going to waste. A 2014 EPA study shows that; America throws away more than 38 million tons of food every year. In context, citizens throw away the amount of food equal to the weight of 1,176,470 mid-sized cars each year. An entire college stadium could be filled, with a single day of food waste produced by America. The waste that goes on is not just immense in weight and size, but also in cost. An NRDC report claims that there is $218 billion a year in food waste costs (Gunders). On a smaller scale, an average American family, a family of four, wastes around $600 of food each year in just meats, fruits, and vegetables. While some food waste is unavoidable, a large portion that is being wasted is completely unnecessary. There are many other ways that food can be used, yet it ends up in a landfill.
<br>
       <p>  Universally, humans produce significant amounts of food waste. Where is it all coming from?  Andy Murdock, a researcher from University from California says, “Globally, roughly half of food waste is created before the food leaves the farm, while the other half happens during processing, distribution, and consumption” (Murdock). In underdeveloped countries, most of the food waste is being produced before the food reaches the home, but in countries such as America, the majority of the waste happens at home (Murdock). People do not set out to waste food, but in a culture with heavy promotion on healthy eating, the food can go bad fast. Of all foods, fruits and vegetables have the highest wasting rates, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The strawberries left in the backpack or the leftovers that were never eaten. Humans end up tossing food daily without an understanding its impact.
       <br>
       <p>  All of the food waste that is happening has an unfavorable effect on the planet. When people toss food into the trash they do not consider where it travels to next: landfills. In these landfills, the food generates a harmful gas, methane. This gas is 23 more times powerful than carbon dioxide, which is produced as well (Schiller). In terms of the amount that is produced, food waste is the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The first two being the countries of China and the United States. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, 6.7 percent of the world's greenhouse gases that are being produced come from food waste. This number might seem small, but it has a significant impact on our environment. Once methane enters the atmosphere it absorbs the sun’s heat and warms the atmosphere. It reduces Earths capability to cool as it forms a layer around the planet trapping in the heat. Overall, though food waste might not be an issue that sticks in our minds, it is definitely one that is having an impact.
       <br>
<p> Despite the significant problems food waste has caused, humans can still prevent future impact. There are quite a few ways that our own food waste can be drastically decreased. For example, meal prepping, buying local produce and composting. Planning meals not only reduces food waste, but it also saves the consumer money. When meals are planned before going to the grocery store, it results in only purchasing food that is certain to be eaten meaning no waste. Buying local produce helps as well. “Reducing food miles helps alleviate our dependence on fossil fuels, reduce air pollution and cut back on greenhouse gas emissions” (“Top Benefits...Food”). Another solution is portion size control. American fast food chains are huge promoters of larger portion sizes that contain an unrealistic amount of calories for one person to consume. For this reason, it is common to not finish all of the food plated resulting in waste. Not only does this help with food waste, but it is beneficial to health as well.
<br>
<p>Food waste is an inevitable byproduct of our society, however composting can help put it to better use while reducing the amount collected in a landfill. Bacterias in the composting pile use oxygen to break down the food waste and create carbon dioxide and heat. Their consumption of the compost material raises the heat to up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit (Ashford). In terms of what can be composted, it depends on the kind of composter is being used, but usually is inclusive of everything except oils and dairy products. Composting recycles food waste and distributes it back to the Earth. The food waste is placed into the composter and then over time is broken down until it can be used in the soil for a garden. According to researchers at the University of Illinois, “Compost will improve the quality of almost any soil, and for this reason, it is most often considered a soil conditioner. Compost improves the structure and texture of the soil enabling it to better retain nutrients, moisture, and air for the betterment of plants” (“Benefits and Uses”). Overall composting is a near perfect solution for food waste.
<br>
<p>At the rate of which waste is currently increasing, a severe detriment to Earth is inevitable. The future Earth can expect will include increased average global temperatures, intense tropical storms, loss of sea ice, and rising sea levels drowning current states such as Florida. There is still time and hope for change. Once humans recognize the impact and acknowledge the significance, food sustainability can become the future.</p>
