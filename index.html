            <p class="text-muted">        400,000.  It is believed that at least 400,000 Rohingyan refugees are crossing the border to Bangladesh, fleeing from Myanmar to escape murder, persecution, discrimination, and destruction.  These people are desperate, doing whatever they can to escape from the Burmese military and government.  It has been noted that the core of the violence has been in the Rakhine state, where groups march into villages, shouting as one refugee reported, “leave, or we will kill you all,”  In this state, the government in Myanmar makes deliberate, accurate attacks against the villages in this state, many homes are burned down, and families are torn apart.  The people of Rakhine state do not have access to education, healthcare, the basic necessities and liberties everyone should have. This is a humanitarian emergency. As many of these refugees are fleeing to camps in Bangladesh, it is crucial to start an integration process so that refugees have an opportunity to restore their ways of life.</p>

        <p class="text-muted">As many people do not know, since 2016 Cameroon has been through some violent changes.Cameroon has two different official languages english-speaking people were now as Anglophone and French Speaking people were known as Francophone. As the Anglophone realize that the policies not in favor for them but against them they started to protest. They demanded for more say in the government but did not agree. The government arrested more than 100 people at a strike, they used brute force to stop organizations and enlisted an Internet blackout only in Anglophone zones. For 3 years schools have been shut down by the immense increasing of riots and violence. People have left the country and the people who can not afford to leave stay in there home in fear. There is a civil war that has been ongoing for 6 years and the president has been doing nothing while the government kills innocent people. So many people don't know that innocent men, women, and children are being murdered just because they want their rights and freedom. One of the steps we can take in ending this disaster that is taking place Cameroon is by spreading awareness and spreading the problems to different peers because one person can change many people lives.</p>

Seeing that the Rohingya Refugee Crisis is the fastest growing refugee emergency in the world, the UNHCR has been providing emergency aid and supplies to help save lives.  Supplies includes sleeping mats, plastic sheets, and kitchen sets.  The UNHCR helps more than 250,000 refugees and pours about 7.8 million dollars into aid.  The UNHCR has also partnered with companies working toward helping the water situaton within the region.  With this help, pipe lines were able to be built to get the refugees fresh water.  Also, latrines were constructed to create more humane conditions for these people.  </p>

                    <p class="text-muted"> The Humanitarian Practice Network, also known as the HPN works hard to put a stop to the refugee crisis in Bangladesh.  NGOs like HPN serve as mediums between the common man, the UN, and the people in need.  For example, HPN fundraises supplies as well as spreads awareness about hte problem at hand.  Like most NGOs, HPN has the common passion for solving such a crisis, but their main issue is funding.  They don't have the resources to give endless amounts of supplies and invest money into building these people new lives.  That being said, it is important that the common man gets involved in helping either the NGO with their work, as well as through donations.  </p>

              Hello! My name is Kayla Wong, and I am a current student at East Brunswick High School. As a young girl, I was always surrounded by the newest technology. As I grew older, my passion and interest in technology grew astronomically. That being said, I got involved with all things technology. From being the STEM Chairperson of the East Brunswick Youth Council to attending the Pace Seidenberg STEM Camp, I made sure I was constantly furthering my knowledge. Starting the summer of my sophomore year, I got involved with the East Brunswick FIRST Robotics team, where we built robots that would later compete in the FIRST Robotics Competitions. Being on this team made me even more passionate about Computer Science and Engineering. I saw how code did not run successfully because of the smallest errors in the script. I saw how different tools could be used in ways other than what they were made for. The creativity and resourcefulness of the team amazed me. Being surrounded by people chasing the same passion as I am, made me a stronger, confident person. Finding my passion was life changing, and I encourage everyone to do the same. I always live with a fire, and I let my passion burn bright for all to see.

            <h7>Hello my name is Cheyenne Ajebe, I am going to be a junior in the fall at Wayne Hills High School.I participate in marching band, symphonic band, and jazz band.I got into coding in the middle of my freshman year when I had to take a half year course on Visual Basic.I was completely in love and I wanted to take more classes surrounding what I learned before. That's when sophomore year I took robotics and it opened my mind to things I never knew I could do. My aunt mention this camp to my mom because she knew how much I love coding and I joined. I so glad I got to meet a group of amazing women and i would definitely not regret coming to this camp. This place made me realize i good to make mistakes cause you can always learn from them and try again. I grateful that I could share my story about my home county and the struggle they are going through. All in all this made me realize how grateful I should be about the opportunities that are available to me here. Thank you for reading our website!  </h7>
